```toml
title = "Languages"
date = "2016-02-04 15:00:00"
slug = "en/docs/cnt/i18n"
hover = "docs"
lang = "en"
template = "docs.html"
```

`PoGo` supports multiple languages to compile contents. The language files saves in `source/lang/language-name.toml(ini)`.

In default, it contains some default values for `PoGo` basic elements:

```toml
# file: source/lang/en.toml

# navigation
[nav]
home = "Home"
archive = "Archive"
about = "About"
source = "Source"

# about post
[post]
list = "All Posts"
archive = "Archives"
tag = "Tags"
readmore = "Read More"

# about pagination
[pager]
prev = "Prev"
next = "Next"
```

You can add your values in section block.

```toml
[block]
item1 = "Item1"
item2 = "Item2"
```

Read [International](/en/docs/tpl/i18n.html) to learn how use i18n in template.

### Global Language

If you want to set global language to compile all pages, write `lang` value:

```toml
[meta]
.....

# make sure there is a language file in this the language name
lang = "en"
```

### Single Page

`Page` can compile in specific language when you set `lang` in front-matter:

```toml
# make sure there is a language file in this the language name
lang = "en"
```
