```toml
title = "Write New Post"
date = "2016-02-05 15:00:00"
slug = "en/guide/write-new-post"
hover = "guide"
lang = "en"
template = "guide.html"
sort = 3
```

To create a new post, run command:

```bash
pogo new post <title>
```
The new post file is created in `source/post/[year]/<title>.md`. For example:

```bash
pogo new post "this is a new post"
```

Result is `source/post/2016/this-is-a-new-post.md`.
